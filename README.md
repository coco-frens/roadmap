plans to get to where we are going

greetings, this is a work in progress, commits are not copy safe nor final. 

This doc is an attempt to classify the COCO eth token, and identify ways to increase utility of the eth token in particular. 

Background

The COCO meme, originally presented by Kero is becoming well known among many PEPE artists. The meme itself has grown into having several offshoots, most with the intention of bringing COCO to various technologies which could benefit from the additional ecosystem a vibrant art space can bring. The original author was looking for a product similar to rare pepes with an open and free trading environment, and offered this on the XCP protocol, a stack which uses bitcoin transactions as a consensus layer for the assets within. Thus, rarecoco.wtf was the first born child of the meme. Stamps, another bitcoin tech that embeds the graphic directly on the bitcoin blockchain have been created as well. These assets are showing signs of growth and strength at the time of this writing.

During the initial deployment, a anonymous party decided to kind of persuade Kero to support a eth speculation token, which at the time many people showed interest in a token on ETH. Typically these tokens of memes are deployed in an anonymous fashion which persuades the community to promote what they believe in and thus we have the meme economy. Recently, another token PEPE on eth, after having a much higher level of success saw their anonymous deployer remove some assets and vanquish themselves from any responsibility to the token. Further, the original deployer of the anonymous COCO token has also taken actions to cause scrutiny, they removed the social accounts. This doesnt mean they have removed themselves entirely, they are probably just busy.

The first thing that must be approached here is how to deal with the Anonymous Deployer.

Solution 1: Reissue the token. This would mean taking a snapshot at a particular point in time and reissuing via airdrop a new version of the token where the community is 100% in control. Issuing a new v2 pool (someone has to fund it) and take on the responsibility of exchange listings and marketing ourselves.

Solution 2: Accept that the 28T (out of 420T) tokens the anonymous deployer holds is a counterparty and start a process to recover or vanquish those tokens, on failure, accept that the tokens held by the anonymous deployer are an acceptable risk for the token holder community. (The data from this occurring with PEPE shows that the price moved less than 1% after their anon's sold)

Either of these solutions requires creating a DAO to make decisions.
