plans to get to where we are going

greetings, this is a work in progress, commits are not copy safe nor final. 

This doc is an attempt to classify the COCO eth token, and identify ways to increase utility of the eth token in particular.

Background

The COCO meme, originally presented by Kero is becoming well known among many PEPE artists. The meme itself has grown into having several offshoots, most with the intention of bringing COCO to various technologies which could benefit from the additional ecosystem a vibrant art space can bring. The original author was looking for a product similar to rare pepes with an open and free trading environment, and offered this on the XCP protocol, a stack which uses bitcoin transactions as a consensus layer for the assets within. Thus, rarecoco.wtf was the first born child of the meme. Stamps, another bitcoin tech that embeds the graphic directly on the bitcoin blockchain have been created as well. These assets are showing signs of growth and strength at the time of this writing.

During the initial deployment, a anonymous party decided to kind of persuade Kero to support a eth speculation token, which at the time many people showed interest in a token on ETH. Typically these tokens of memes are deployed in an anonymous fashion which persuades the community to promote what they believe in and thus we have the meme economy.

The anonymous deployers then decided to leave the project and there was a community takeover.  They then sold all of their vesting tokens they had and have zero interests in the coin forthcoming.

Adding utility

1: AI rendered NFT's
There is a set of AI rendered images already and more can be easily generated. These are a contribution by the author @snowkidind in order to provide some alternate versions of the COCO meme to the masses. These AI images can be issued as NFT's at which point, the minting process can add utility to the token. How?

NFT contract receives COCO and burns 100% of the deposited coco.
NFT Contract receives ETH, buys COCO and burns 100% of the coco, leaving the eth in the pool.

I think it would be important for the token in its current embodiement to allocate an amount while the price is fairly disposable in order to provide some of the utility as described above. Mostly because increasing the utility of the token would lead to success regardless of a token reissue. This allocation should be used for DAO transactions, self sponsored CEX submissions, and perhaps bounties and rewards for community involvement.
